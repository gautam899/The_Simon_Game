1. The Simon Game is a game of short-term memory Skill game developed by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.
2. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.
3. This project is about creating the game using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

# How to play the game
1. Click any key on the Keyboard to start the game. The moment you press any key on the board, you will see a flash on one of the buttons and "Level 1" on the top of the screen.
2. The first flash on one of the buttons indicates that this is a button the user needs to start from. As you press that button you will move to level 2 and will see another flash on one of the buttons.
3. Now you need to repeat the sequence and press the buttons in the new Sequence starting from the beginning.
4. As you will keep moving on to the next levels the sequence will keep becoming longer to remember and more complicated. If you press the wrong button in the sequence the screen will flash Red and it will say " Game over, press any key to restart".
5. The moment you press any key on the keyboard the game will restart from level 1.
